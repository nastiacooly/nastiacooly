- 👋 Hi, I’m Anastasia (@nastiacooly).
- 👀 I’m interested in web-development and, particularly, in front-end development.
- 🌱 In my projects I use HTML5, CSS3 (Sass/Scss), Bootstrap and vanilla Javascript. Sometimes I develop backend for my projects too with Python (Django Framework).
- 👩🏻 Also, I develop web-apps with React library.
